# Note: this cheatsheet is created on July 2023 for a course I did learning to use Rust to build on Solana network.  Until July 2023, Solana only works on Linux and iOS, and not on Windows. 
#
# Thus, to work on Solana on a Windows machine you need to do the followings:
## 1. open powershell as administrator
## 2. install ubuntu using the following command:
###     wsl --install
## 3. upon finishing install, setup (username and password) and restart the machine update the the library using the following command:
###     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
